To specify that the Virtual API is to be secured via API key, the user must configure an API Key Auth rule and update the Virtual Service to use that Auth Rule.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a Virtual API as outlined in [Create Virtual API](/docs/usage/create/index.html).

## Via the Amplify Management APIs

## Via Axway CLI

## Via UI

OAuth auth rule cannot be configured via the UI currently.
